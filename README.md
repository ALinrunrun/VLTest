# VLTest
VLTest is a black-box testing framework for vision–language models that systematically generates semantics-preserving test cases. It explores discrete visual latent spaces and bounded textual neighborhoods to uncover behavioral inconsistencies across VLM tasks, datasets, and architectures.
